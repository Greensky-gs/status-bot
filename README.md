# status-bot
 A simple script for a bot that checks if you're bot's online

## Discord
This is a code for detect when your bot's down
This code is made for Discord.js v14

## Important
When hosting, host the code of the two bots **on two servers**.
Because if bot A crashes, the server will be down.
If the server is down, the bot can't do anything (He sleeps)

## Usage
See the two directories, `bot_a`, for your main bot, and `bot_b` for the checker

## Handler
The handler used for `bot_b` is mine (check at [this adress](https://github.com/Greensky-gs/event-handler))
